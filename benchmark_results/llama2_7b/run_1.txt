The error message suggests that there is a mismatch between the embedding dimensions in the `vector_db` and the `query`. The expected embedding dimension is 768, but the actual embedding dimension is 384. This can happen if the `vector_db` was created with a different set of features or if the `query` was normalized differently.

To fix this error, you can try the following solutions:

1. Check the dimensions of the `vector_db` and the `query`: Make sure that the embedding dimension of the `vector_db` is 768, and that the `query` has the same number of features as the `vector_db`. If the `query` has a different number of features, you may need to pad it with zeros to match the size of the `vector_db`.
2. Normalize the `query`: The error message suggests that the embedding dimension mismatch is due to a difference in the normalization of the `query` and the `vector_db`. Try normalizing the `query` using the same method as the `vector_db`, such as Min-Max Scaling or Z-Scoring.
3. Use a different similarity measure: The error message suggests that the `similarity_search` function is expecting a specific embedding dimension for the query. If you are getting an embedding dimension mismatch, try using a different similarity measure, such as cosine similarity or BCE. These measures do not require the same embedding dimension as the `vector_db`.
4. Check for data inconsistencies: The error message could also be caused by data inconsistencies in the `vector_db` or the `query`. Make sure that the data in both is consistent and matching, and that there are no missing values or outliers that could cause the error.
5. Upgrade to a newer version of RAG: The error message suggests that the `similarity_search` function is expecting an embedding dimension of 768, which may be a default value in older versions of RAG. Try upgrading to a newer version of RAG to see if the error persists.

By trying these solutions, you should be able to identify and fix the cause of the error and retrieve the documents as expected.
