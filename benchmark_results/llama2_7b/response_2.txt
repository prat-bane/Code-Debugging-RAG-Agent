The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the embedding dimension expected by the `similarity_search` function and the actual embedding dimension used in the `vector_db` model. The function is expecting an embedding dimension of 768, but the actual embedding dimension used in the `vector_db` model is 384.

To solve this issue, you can either:

1. Update the `vector_db` model to use an embedding dimension of 768. This can be done by setting the `embedding_dim` parameter in the `VectorDatabase` constructor to 768. For example:
```python
vector_db = VectorDatabase(file_path, embedding_dim=768)
```
2. Adjust the query vector to have an embedding dimension of 768 before passing it to the `similarity_search` function. This can be done using the `vectorized` function from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module:
```python
import sklearn.preprocessing as pp

query = pp.vectorize(query, vector_length=768)
results = vector_db.similarity_search(query, k=3)
```
By adjusting the query vector to have an embedding dimension of 768, you can fix the mismatch and avoid the `IndexError`.
