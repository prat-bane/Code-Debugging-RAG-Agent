The error message you provided indicates that the embedding dimension of the query and the vector database are not matching, which is causing an IndexError. The solution to this problem is to make sure that the embedding dimension of the query and the vector database are the same.

Here are some possible ways to address this issue:

1. Check the embedding dimension of the query: Double-check that the embedding dimension of the query is set to 768, which is the value specified in the error message. Make sure that the embedding dimension is correctly defined in the code and that it matches the value specified in the error message.
2. Adjust the embedding dimension of the vector database: If the embedding dimension of the vector database is different from the query, you may need to adjust the embedding dimension of the vector database to match the embedding dimension of the query. You can do this by modifying the `vector_db` object in the code to have an embedding dimension of 768.
3. Use a different similarity measure: The error message suggests that the similarity measure used in the `similarity_search()` function is not compatible with the embedding dimension of the query. You may need to use a different similarity measure, such as BCE or Cosine, which are more robust to differences in embedding dimensions.
4. Check for other potential issues: There could be other issues that are causing this error, such as improperly defined vectors or errors in the data loading process. Make sure that all vectors are properly defined and loaded into the vector database, and check for any other potential issues that may be causing this error.

By addressing these possible solutions, you should be able to resolve the IndexError and successfully retrieve the documents from the vector database using the `similarity_search()` function.
