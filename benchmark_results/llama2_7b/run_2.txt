The error message you provided indicates that the embedding dimension of the vectors in the `vector_db` is different than the one expected by the `similarity_search()` function in RAG. The error message specifically states that the expected embedding dimension is 768, but the actual embedding dimension is 384.

To fix this issue, you have two options:

1. Change the embedding dimension of the vectors in the `vector_db` to match the expected dimension (768) before running the `similarity_search()` function. You can do this by modifying the code that generates the vectors or by resizing the vectors after they are generated.
2. Use a different similarity search algorithm that does not require an embedding dimension match. For example, you could use the `cosine_similarity()` function instead of `similarity_search()`. This function does not have the same requirement for embedding dimensions and can be used to compare vectors regardless of their dimensionality.

Here is an example of how you could modify the code to change the embedding dimension:
```
# Change the embedding dimension of the vectors in vector_db
vector_db = VectorDatabase(vec_dim=768)

# Retrieve documents using the modified vector database
results = vector_db.similarity_search(query, k=3)
```
Alternatively, you could use a different similarity search algorithm that does not require an embedding dimension match:
```
# Use cosine similarity instead of similarity search
results = cosine_similarity(query, vector_db.vectors, k=3)
```
